# UFOs
Week 11

The purpose of this project is to create an informative and searchable website for UFO afficianados.  A place they can gather data to support their ideas.
Using the search criteria is quite simple. Anyone on the website is able to select from one to five attributes to find the information they are looking for.  Or, they have the option to scroll through all of the data by selecting no filters at all.
One drawback of this new design is there is quite a bit of data, and only certain search parameters will trigger the filters.  I would recommend instead of having keyboard inputs that you have a drop down selection of search items. Someone might not, for example, immediately think of "light" as a shape. Some attribution would also be good.  Where did this data come from? Has it been vetted?  Are these first person accounts?
